This is what node-bots is all about.\r\n\r\n## johnny-five\r\n[johnny-five](https://www.npmjs.com/package/johnny-five) is the thing that bridges the gap between node.js and the devices that operate in the physical world, like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. It's a node module, so you can install it and require it just like *fs* or *express*.\r\n\r\n## Hello world\r\nIf you have an Arduino, follow these instructions to get your board connected. If you don't have a board, no problem, you can still get started with nodebot-workshop...\r\n\r\n## nodebot-workshop\r\n[nodebot-workshop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodebot-workshop) is a little command line program that gives you series of easy code challenges that teach you how to write node.js for the Arduino. Do a global install and then run it from the command line. It works whether you have a board connected or not.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
